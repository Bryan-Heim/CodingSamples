The program runs completely fine and should never give the user any indication that something has gone wrong and all of the required features are included in this working project.
<br>
<br>
<b>Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):</b><br>  I commented as much of the code as I could to clarify any problems and to make the flow of the code easier to read. Everything on the rubric is working and functioning great in this project. I have even included two of the optional extra credit ideas. One is a link to an html form that allows users to create an account. This then passes to a php file that verifies the data and if no error, creates new username and password. The second extra credit I included was that concerning picked quizzes. I added a file called used_quizzes.txt which contains the index of the quiz in allquizzes.txt that has already been used and in my source code I check this file to compare with the random quiz chose. If the random is equal to a chosen index, it choses another random number and compares again until it finally finds a new unused index.
